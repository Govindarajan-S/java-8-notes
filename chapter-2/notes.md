# Modulus Operator
- For a given divisor y (+ve or -ve) and positive dividend, the result produced is between 0 and (y - 1).
- For a given divisor y (+ve or -ve) and negative dividend, the result produced is between (-y + 1) and 0.

# Numeric Promotion Rules
- If two values have different data types, Java will automatically promote one of the values to the larger of the two data types.
- If one of the values is integral and the other is floating-point, Java will automatically promote the integral value to the floating-point value’s data type.
- Smaller data types, namely byte, short, and char, are first promoted to int any time they’re used with a Java binary arithmetic operator, even if neither of the operands is int.
- After all promotion has occurred and the operands have the same data type, the result- ing value will have the same data type as its promoted operands.

# Java Unary Operator
![Java Unary Operator](unary-operator.png "Unary Operator")
- In Java 1 and true are not related in any way, just as 0 and false are not related.
- Hence we cannot apply logical operator on numeric value and numeric operator on logical values.

# Compound Assignment Operators
- The left-hand side of the compound operator can only be applied to a variable that is already defined and cannot be used to declare a new variable. Otherwise it would fail to compile.
- Compound operators are useful for more than just shorthand—they can also save us from having to explicitly cast a value.
```
long x = 10;
int y = 3;
y = y * x; // Does not compile
y *= x; // Does compile
```

# Short Circuit Operators
- The short-circuit operators are nearly identical to the logical operators, & and |, respectively, except that the right-hand side of the expression may never be evaluated if the final result can be determined by the left-hand side of the expression.
- A most common use case for short-circuit operators is used for null checking an object before performing an operation.

# Equality Operators
- Equality operators are used in one of three different scenarios:
	- Comparing two numeric data type. If the numeric values are of different type then the values are automatically promoted.
	- Comparing two boolean values.
	- Comparing two objects, including null as well.

# Switch Statement
![Switch Data Type](switch-datatypes.png "Data Types supported by switch")
- The values in each case statement must be compile-time constant values of the same data type as the switch value. This means you can use only literals, enum constants, or final constant variables of the same data type. By final constant, we mean that the variable must be marked with the final modifier and initialized with a literal value in the same expression in which it is declared.
